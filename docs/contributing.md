## Contributing Code

If you are interested in contributing code, we would greatly appreciate it! We use the Go language to implement INS-C. First and foremost, you should be familiar with Go and can build the INS-C Node on your own. After that, you can review the issues and pick one to work on. Start small and start quickly - we will be happy to help you.

When writing code, please follow the guidelines below:

- For code style, we are following the [community standard of Go](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/); it is not a strict requirement, and we are trying our best.
- For commit style, we are following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- For branch management, we are following some tailored [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
